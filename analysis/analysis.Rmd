# Survival

## Survival Calculations

```{r death_count}
# === Survival summary by block and round ===
survival_summary <- aphid_long %>%
  group_by(treatment, block, round) %>%  # Group data by treatment condition, experimental block, and round
  summarise(
    # Count how many alates were alive in each group (handling NAs just in case)
    alive_n = sum(alate_alive == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE),
    # Count how many alates were dead in each group
    dead_n  = sum(alate_alive == "No",  na.rm = TRUE),
    # Compute total number of alates observed (alive + dead)
    total   = alive_n + dead_n,
    # Calculate percent survival per block per round (0–100%)
    survival_pct = 100 * alive_n / total,
    # Drop grouping structure after summarising (avoids nested data frames in later steps)
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# === Average survival across blocks ===
survival_summary_avg <- survival_summary %>%
  group_by(treatment, round) %>%  # Now group just by treatment and round (collapsed across blocks)
  summarise(
    # Compute the mean survival percentage across all blocks in each treatment/round
    mean_survival = mean(survival_pct, na.rm = TRUE),
    # Calculate standard error: standard deviation divided by square root of the number of blocks
    se_survival   = sd(survival_pct, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),
    # Drop grouping again for a clean summary table
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

## Survival Plots

# Fecundity

## Fecundity Calculations
```{r fecundity-calc}
# === Step 1: Calculate fecundity summary by block and round ===
fecundity_by_block <- aphid_long %>%
  # Group data by treatment condition, block (replicate), and round (e.g. R1 vs R2)
  group_by(treatment, block, round) %>%
  # Summarise the fecundity statistics within each block × treatment × round group
  summarise(
    mean_fecundity = mean(nymphs, na.rm = TRUE), # Mean number of nymphs per alate
    se_nymphs = sd(nymphs, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()), # Standard error = SD / sqrt(n blocks)
    
    .groups = "drop" # Ungroup to simplify downstream summarization
  )

# === Step 2: Aggregate fecundity across blocks for each treatment and round ===
fecundity_by_treatment <- aphid_long %>%
  # Now group by treatment and round only (collapse across blocks)
  group_by(treatment, round) %>%
  # Summarise the average of block means and calculate standard error
  summarise(
    mean_nymphs = mean(nymphs, na.rm = TRUE), # Mean of block-level means
    se_nymphs = sd(nymphs, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()), # Standard error = SD / sqrt(n blocks)
    .groups = "drop" # Drop grouping for a flat summary table
  )
```
